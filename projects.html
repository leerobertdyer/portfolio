                        I initially had my authentication route built using <span class="highlights">BCRYPT</span> to
                        hash passwords, and cookies to store user information, but quickly hit walls with the method.
                        After several dozens of hours of fixes and patches, I finally realized it was easier and better
                        to let <span class="painPoints">Firebase</span> do the hard work, and as a result my app now
                        functions on mobile devices without jumping through extra hoops.

                        I initially thought using dropbox made sense because the site is designed to handle music files,
                        but also profile pictures and other user content. But I've had difficulty with 3rd party cookies
                        using this format, not to mention long load times and issues with registration. I am looking
                        into using firebase storage as an alternative.

                        Using flask always feels right, and part of that is all the tools that come with it or work with

                        comma or sometimes all caps.
                        It took a lot of finessing to get the date times in an appropriate format for database to be
